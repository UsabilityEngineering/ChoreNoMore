This view, accessible at any point by clicking on a profile picture of a user in the main content of a page, shows you the current status of chores a user has completed. For example, if there is a weekly chore that is due later this week the user has not completed, it will show as "uncompleted", and if the user then marks that as completed, it will move to "completed."



## Day View

The day view, accessible by pressing any date on the calendar, allows you to get a view of what times of days chores were completed and are supposed to be completed by.
