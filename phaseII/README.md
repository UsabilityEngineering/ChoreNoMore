# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

Chore No More is going to be a website that can support a wide range of users in scheduling chores with the members of their households. In this phase, our team focused on developing our wireframes for the site. We also received feedback on our wireframes in the form of informal feedback from our software engineering team and detailed cognitive walkthroughs from our peers. We intend for this website to streamline and automate the process of scheduling chores for both families and roommates. 

## Methods

During this phase of development, our team used both cognitive walkthroughs and informal feedback to enhance the website’s design. The cognitive walkthroughs were completed by three of our peers; They were told to choose one persona and an accompanying scenario to test on our wireframes. Each user then provided us with a write-up detailing each action they took to complete the scenario. Additionally, the users described if they believed their chosen action was correct and made progress towards the goal. These walkthroughs helped us to better understand the functionality of our site when viewed from an outside perspective. The other research method that allowed us to gain insight into our design was the informal feedback we received from our software developers. They assessed our wireframes by going through and attempting to complete different tasks they felt were important to the site's functionality. 

## Findings

In our cognitive walkthrough, we discovered:
* Our designs were generally very effective. Two out of the three cognitive walkthroughs conducted found no issues with our application. However, one of the cognitive walkthroughs did note some confusion when it came to figuring out what the pin code did when creating an account for your child.
* Additionally, one of the cognitive walkthroughs noted that the labeling of some of the buttons in the application were confusing. For example, we have a check box labelled just “hidden” to mark a chore as hidden in the chore creation menu.
* That cognitive walkthrough was also unsuccessful in completing the scenario “Oops Roman forgot” which involves setting up push notifications for a given chore. This was due to an oversight in the wireframes we made which has since been remedied.

We also received some informal feedback from our software engineering team:
* Our software engineering team found that our designs were generally well thought out and did not have trouble completing the tasks they attempted.
* However, we received some verbal feedback from the software engineers noting that the home page was cluttered and felt overloaded with information upon first seeing it.  


## Conclusions

Our research methods, cognitive walkthroughs and informal feedback, provided valuable insight into the effectiveness of Chore No More’s design. The majority of the feedback was positive, with most users finding the wireframes easy to navigate. However, some areas of improvement were identified, such as confusion over PIN codes in account creation, unclear labeling, and a cluttered homepage. We have already addressed some of these issues and intend to fix the rest of them as we move on to the next phase of our research. This will include rethinking the child account creation process, redesigning the home page, and rewording labeling throughout the application.

## Caveats

One major caveat of our research methods was that only a small selection of our peers performed cognitive walkthroughs. Not every scenario was explored or tested which could have caused some UX issues to go unnoticed. Additionally, cognitive walkthroughs do not show us how users interact with our wireframes; They only provide the user’s interpretation of their interactions. Another limitation of our research methods is that the informal feedback we received from our software developers could be biased. The largely positive feedback we received from them could be due to the fact that they already have an idea of how the designs are meant to work. Given that they have spent many hours designing similar functionality themselves.
