# Chore No More

Chore No More is going to be a website that can support a wide range of users in scheduling chores with the members of their household. Users will be able to create chores, assign chores to household members, access a calendar, receive reminders, and much more. We intend for this website to streamline and automate the process of scheduling chores for both families and roommates.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

The chore management application niche is an area ripe for disruption. We identified two primary end-users of such an app: **young adult roommates and families**. We performed research into the chore-organizational needs of these two groups.
* A competitive analysis of competing products revealed there is **no current market leader** in this segment.
  - Rather, the most popular competitors are real-world solutions such as a communal whiteboard or casual agreements.
  - **Most competitors ignore the “young adult roommate” demographic**, and are rather focused on families with children.
  - We centered further research on improving the chore process for college students and families. We will meet the unique needs and preferences of both groups through the features of our website.
* A heuristic evaluation of a leading competitor found many low-hanging fruit improvements that could be made in error prevention and visibility of system status.
* New personas and scenarios helped us identify useful features which we illustrated in sketches:
  - A function to **cycle chores** between users to ensure fairness between roommates.
  - A **log of completed chores** to allow parents to see if their kids have been doing their chores.
  - A function to allow parents to send **push notifications** with chores to do to their kids’ phones.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

We created an initial wireframe design of our chore management application, Chore No More. We had detailed cognitive walkthroughs conducted on it and asked for informal feedback from our software engineering team, finding:

* **Our designs are suitable for basic tasks.** Common tasks such as creating new chores and marking them as completed. However, during the cognitive walkthrough, we learned that certain features we outlined were not yet implemented. This has since been rectified.
Informal feedback and cognitive walkthroughs for our wireframes for Chore No More found that we are heading in the right direction with our designs.
* However, some areas of improvement were identified.
  * We identified several potential areas of confusion for users surrounding the **naming of labels and buttons**.
  * **The layout of our wireframes is cluttered.** A piece of informal feedback that we received from the software engineers was that our layout was cluttered. As we move towards making a prototype we intend to simplify the displayed information to the user.
  * **The child account creation flow is unlearnable.** A cognitive walkthrough identified some confusion over the purpose of setting a PIN code when creating an account for your child.

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Executive Summary**

We created a prototype for users to test the current features of Chore No More. We had feedback from 5 different users who followed the same protocol along with the supervision of a moderator. While the feedback from the test was generally positive, we noted several possible areas of improvement:

* There were issues of **salience**: Many noted difficulty reading labels due to their size. For example, several users encountered difficulty finding the top navigation bar or the radio buttons inside the “Manage Chores” menu.
* Aspects of the app are not **learnable**: Several users were confused about the terminology used in the application. The main sticking points were the terms “Household” and “Cycle Chores.” However, one user noted specific pleasure in using the term “Household.” We should introduce a tutorial flow for adding users to make users more accustomed to the term “Household.” Additionally, the term “Cycle Chores” should be changed to “Shuffle Chores” to more accurately convey its functionality. This should be addressed by **increasing the font size** used throughout the application.
* Our designs could have improved **error tolerance**: One user clicked “Manage Chores” with the expectation they could add a chore from that menu. They had difficulty recovering from this error with the current design. This issue could be fixed by adding an alternate method to add chores inside the “Manage Chores” menu.

Despite this feedback, most users said they would use the site again. This suggests that we are **heading in the right direction** with our designs. Although valuable, the feedback was only from college students and not from any families affecting the data in favor of one demographic. With all the insight and data we have gained, we will be able to improve Chore No More in the future.
