# Chore No More

Chore No More is going to be a website that can support a wide range of users in scheduling chores with the members of their household. Users will be able to create chores, assign chores to household members, access a calendar, receive reminders, and much more. We intend for this website to streamline and automate the process of scheduling chores for both families and roommates.
