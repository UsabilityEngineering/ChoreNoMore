# Chore No More

Chore No More is going to be a website that can support a wide range of users in scheduling chores with the members of their household. Users will be able to create chores, assign chores to household members, access a calendar, receive reminders, and much more. We intend for this website to streamline and automate the process of scheduling chores for both families and roommates.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

The chore management application niche is an area ripe for disruption. We identified two primary end-users of such an app: **young adult roommates and families**. We performed research into the chore-organizational needs of these two groups.
* A competitive analysis of competing products revealed there is **no current market leader** in this segment.
  - Rather, the most popular competitors are real-world solutions such as a communal whiteboard or casual agreements.
  - **Most competitors ignore the “young adult roommate” demographic**, and are rather focused on families with children.
  - We centered further research on improving the chore process for college students and families. We will meet the unique needs and preferences of both groups through the features of our website.
* A heuristic evaluation of a leading competitor found many low-hanging fruit improvements that could be made in error prevention and visibility of system status.
* New personas and scenarios helped us identify useful features which we illustrated in sketches:
  - A function to **cycle chores** between users to ensure fairness between roommates.
  - A **log of completed chores** to allow parents to see if their kids have been doing their chores.
  - A function to allow parents to send **push notifications** with chores to do to their kids’ phones.
