# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Chore No More is going to be a website that can support a wide range of users in scheduling chores with the members of their household. Users will be able to create chores, assign chores to household members, access a calendar, receive reminders, and much more. We intend for this website to streamline and automate the process of scheduling chores for both families and roommates.

## Methods

As a part of our research into the current state of chore organization apps, our team used several usability research methods. We conducted a competitive analysis of four popular chore-taking applications and methods, then evaluated their relative strengths and weaknesses. We took what we found to be the standout application, Spotless for iOS, and conducted a more detailed heuristic evaluation using Nielson’s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design. And finally, we developed Personas that we believe to be representative of core demographics that would find use in a chore organization application.

## Findings

### Competitive Analysis
  - We found that there are only a few applications that have gained market dominance.
  - The apps that do exist all either have significant flaws, have an expensive subscription, or have dated designs.
  - The most intuitive and high-quality competitors are analog systems such as informally talking with people or maintaining a chore chart.

### Heuristic Evaluation
  - We found that the Spotless app for iOS had grave flaws with its design that limited its utility.
  - The app obfuscated the recurring nature of chores behind an opaque “dirtiness” system.
  - There was no way to view all of the currently outstanding chores in a single view.

### Personas and Scenarios
  - We identified two core groups of users for chore organization apps: young adults with roommates, and families.
  - Based on our drafted scenarios, we found that these two groups require very different functionality from a chore-organization app.
  - For example, a family might want to have a permissions system to forcibly assign chores to their children. Meanwhile, roommates might want a system that allows them to randomly assign chores between them to ensure the work is distributed evenly.


## Conclusions

In our findings, we saw that most competitors had either an overcomplicated or visually unappealing UI. In some cases, buttons and visuals masquerading as such would be counterintuitive or unnecessary. A few of the competitive apps even had simple and inconvenient issues such as making the entire chore system based on “dirtiness”. Even with these issues, competitors may have charged subscriptions to use the app or all its features.  With these findings, Chore No More seeks to improve in these areas by being completely free, having a simple intuitive, and user-friendly UI, and not having unnecessary visuals or features that may overcomplicate and confuse the user. 

## Caveats

Our research did come with a few limitations. The largest of which there were not many major competitors. We found that our largest competitor is a physical chore chart which is difficult to compare and/or replicate with a website or application. Another limitation was that we chose the four largest competitors but did not look at many other applications other than at a glance. In this, we did note that most apps are structured similarly in how they perform. Another issue being all the apps seemed to be centered around families and not college students or adults with roommates.
