# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Chore No More is going to be a website that can support a wide range of users in scheduling chores with the members of their household. Users will be able to create chores, assign chores to household members, access a calendar, receive reminders, and much more. We intend for this website to streamline and automate the process of scheduling chores for both families and roommates.

## Methods

As a part of our research into the current state of chore organization apps, our team used several usability research methods. We conducted a competitive analysis of four popular chore-taking applications and methods, then evaluated their relative strengths and weaknesses. We took what we found to be the standout application, Spotless for iOS, and conducted a more detailed heuristic evaluation using Nielson’s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design. And finally, we developed Personas that we believe to be representative of core demographics that would find use in a chore organization application.

## Findings

### Competitive Analysis
  - We found that there are only a few applications that have gained market dominance.
  - The apps that do exist all either have significant flaws, have an expensive subscription, or have dated designs.
  - The most intuitive and high-quality competitors are analog systems such as informally talking with people or maintaining a chore chart.

### Heuristic Evaluation
  - We found that the Spotless app for iOS had grave flaws with its design that limited its utility.
  - The app obfuscated the recurring nature of chores behind an opaque “dirtiness” system.
  - There was no way to view all of the currently outstanding chores in a single view.

### Personas and Scenarios
  - We identified two core groups of users for chore organization apps: young adults with roommates, and families.
  - Based on our drafted scenarios, we found that these two groups require very different functionality from a chore-organization app.
  - For example, a family might want to have a permissions system to forcibly assign chores to their children. Meanwhile, roommates might want a system that allows them to randomly assign chores between them to ensure the work is distributed evenly.


## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
